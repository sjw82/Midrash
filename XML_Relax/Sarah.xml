        <versenum>Genesis 17:15</versenum>
        <versetext> And Elohim said to Avraham [As for] Sarai your wife, do not call her by the name
            Sarai, for Sarah is her name.</versetext>
        <versenum>Genesis 17:16</versenum>
        <versetext>I will bless her, and I will also give you a son through her. I will bless her,
            and she will be [a mother] of nations [assemblies], kings of peoples [who rule over
            nations] will descend from her.</versetext>
        <versenum>Genesis 17:17</versenum>
        <versetext>Avraham fell on his face and laughed [rejoiced]. He said in his heart: Can a
            hundred year old man have children? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old give
            birth?</versetext>
        <versenum>Genesis 17:18</versenum>
        <versetext>And Avraham said to [before] Elohim: May it be granted that Yishmael live before
            You.</versetext>
        <versenum>Genesis 17:19</versenum>
        <versetext> Elohim said: Indeed, your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him
            Yitzchok. I will establish My covenant with him as an eternal covenant to his
            descendants after him.</versetext>

            Said R. Tanhuma: By an effort of will power they brought forth their virginity, and
            conceived at the second “act of intercourse”. [The first act is what they did to
            themselves. Said Rabbi Chanina ben Pazi: Thorns are neither weeded nor sown, but they
            grow and spring up on their own. But how much suffering and effort for wheat to grow!
            Why were the matriarchs barren? Rabbi Levi said in Rabbi Shila’s name and Rabbi Chelbo
            in R. Yochanan’s name: Because the Holy One of Blessing yearns for their prayers and
            supplications, as it is written 'O my dove, you on the clefts of the rock let Me see
            your face, let Me hear your voice' (Song of Songs 2:14): Why did I make you barren? In
            order to 'see your face... hear your voice'. Rabbi Azariah said in the name of Rabbi
            Yochanan bar Papa: So that their husbands might cling to them in their beauty. Rabbi
            Huna in the name of Rabbi Hiya bar Abba said: So that they might pass the greater part
            of their life without hard work. Rabbi Huna and R. Avun in the name of Rabbi Meir: So
            that their husbands might derive pleasure from them, for when a woman is with child she
            is disfigured and does not care for her appearance. The ninety years that Sarah did not
            bear she was like a bride in her canopy. Ladies would come to ask how she was, and she
            would say to them, 'Go and ask about the welfare of this wretched woman [Hagar]!' Hagar
            would tell them: 'My mistress Sarai is not inside what she is outside: she appears to be
            righteous but she is not righteous, had she been a righteous woman, see how many years
            have passed without her conceiving, whereas I conceived in one night!' Said Sarah: 'Am I
            going to argue with this woman?! I should argue with her master!...</p>
        <p> 'And Avram said to Sarai: do it her what is good in your eyes!' (Gen. 19:6) He said to
            her: "what do I care about her well being or her harm? [But] It is written: 'You will
            not deal with her as a slave since you humbled her' (Deuteronomy 21:14), and this one,
            after we made her suffer, we will enslave her? I don't care about her well being or her
            harm. [But] It is written 'he shall not have the right to sell her to foreigners, since
            he broke faith with her' (Exodus 21:8) and this one, after we made her a master we will
            make her a slave? I don't care about her well being or her harm." 'Then Sarai treated
            her harshly, and she ran away from her.' Rabbi Aba bar Kahana said: she forbade her from
            having sexual relations. Rabbi Berachia said: she slapped her face with a slipper. Rabbi
            Berachia in the name of Rabbi Aba Bar Kahana said: She made her carry water buckets and
            bath towels to the baths. And she called the name of Ad-nai who talked to her 'You are
            El-Roi' (Gen. 16:13) Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon and Rabbi Yochanan said, in the name of
            Rabbi Eleazar Bar Shimeon: The Holy One of Blessing did not grant speaking with women,
            with the exception of that righteous one [Sarah], and even that had a particular reason.
            Rabbi Aba said, in the name of Rabbi Beiri: How many roundabouts He did in order to talk
            to her! 'He said: 'no, you did laugh!'' (Gen. 18:16) But it is written: 'and she called
            the name of Ad-nai who talked to her 'You are El-Roi''! Rabbi Yehoshua Bar Nechemiah
            said: it was through an angel. But it is written: 'And God said to her'(Gen. 25:23)!
            Said Rabbi Levi, in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, in the name of Rabbi Yosi ben Zimra: it
            was through a name. 'You are El Roi' - said Rabbi Aivu: You are the one who sees the
            sufferings of the persecuted. 'Since she said: also, here [halom], I have seen after the
            One Who sees me.' She said: Not only I was granted a talk, but even royalty, as it is
            written: 'You that brought me this far [halom] (II Sam. 7:18). Not only I was granted to
            see with my mistress, but even if my mistress were with me right now she would not have
            seen. Another interpretation: Not only I was granted to see with my mistress, but now
            even when I am alone! Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman said: this is similar to a lady to whom
            the king said 'pass before me'. She passed before him but was relying on her slave, and
            hiding her face, and she did not see the king - but the slave did. </p>

        <p>AND SARAH SAID: GOD HAS MADE JOY FOR ME; EVERY ONE THAT HEARS WILL REJOICE WITH ME (Gen.
            21:6). R. Berekiah, R. Judah b. R. Simon, and R. Hanan in the name of R. Samuel b. R.
            Isaac said: If Reuben has cause to rejoice, what does it matter to Simeon? Similarly, if
            Sarah was remembered, what did it matter to others? But when the matriarch Sarah was
            remembered [gave birth], many other barren women were remembered with her; many deaf
            gained their hearing; many blind had their eyes opened, many insane became sane. For
            ‘making’ [HAS MADE] is mentioned here, and also elsewhere, viz. And he made a release to
            the provinces (Est. II, 18). As the making mentioned there means that a gift was granted
            to the world,l so the making mentioned here means that a gift was granted to the world.
            R. Levi said: She increased the light of the luminaries: ‘making’ is mentioned here,
            viz. GOD HAS MADE FOR ME, while elsewhere it says, And God made the two lights (Gen. I,
            16).</p>
        <p>AND SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN etc - Rabbi Shimeon bar Yohai said: Rabbi
            Akiva used to interpret this to his [Ishmael’s] shame, Rabbi Akiba lectured: AND SARAH
            SAW [THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN, WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO AVRAHAM, MAKING SPORT.] Now
            'making sport' refers to nothing else but sexual immorality, as in the verse, "The
            Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to make sport of me. (Gen. 39:17).
            This teaches that Sarah saw Ishmael ravish maidens, seduced married women and dishonored
            them. R. Ishmael taught: This term 'making sport' refers to idolatry, as in the verse,
            "And the people sat to eat and drink and got up to make sport' (Exodus 32:6). This
            teaches that Sarah saw Ishmael build altars, catch locusts, and sacrifice them. R.
            Eleazar said: The term 'making sport' refers to bloodshed, as in the verse, "Let the
            young men, please, arise and make sport before us" (II Sam. 2:14) Rabbi Azariah said in
            Rabbi Levi’s name: Ishmael said to Isaac: 'Let us go and see our pieces in the field'
            and he would pick up the bow and shoot arrows, aiming in Itzchak's direction, while
            pretending to be playing (making sport), as it is written: "as a madman who casts
            fire-brands, arrows, and death; so is the man that deceives his neighbor, and said: 'I
            am just joking (making sport)'. And I [Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai] say that this is to be
            interpreted to the praise [of Ishmael]. This expression of making sport is only used as
            'inheritance'. In the moment that Itzchak our father was born all were happy. Ishmael
            said to them: are you dumb? I am the first-born, I am going to receive double portion
            [of the inheritance], that from the answer of Sarah our mother to Avraham 'because the
            son of this maidservant will not inherit with my son, with Itzchak' you learn that he
            would not inherit 'with my son' - even if he wasn't Itzchak - and 'with Itzchak' - even
            if he wasn't my son. All the more so [this is true] 'with my son, with Itzchak'.</p>

            was born. The day that Aba Hoshaya died Rabbi Hoshaya was born and it was written about
            him "The sun rises and the sun goes down." Before the sun of Moses set the sun of Joshua
            shone forth as it is written, "God said to Moses, take Joshua Son of Nun" (Numbers
            27:18). Before the sun of Joshua set the sun of Itaniel son of Kenaz shone forth as it
            is said, "Itaniel son of Kenaz took it" (Judges 1:13). Before the sun of Eli the priest
            set, the sun of Samuel shone forth, "the lamp of God had not yet gone out and Samuel lay
            on the sanctuary of God" (1 Sam 3:3). Rabbi Yochanan said, "like a perfect calf." Before
            the God causes the sun of Sarah to set, he causes the sun of Rebecca to shine forth. For
            first it says "Behold Malkah also bore children" (Gen 22:20) and after "and the life
            Sarah was one hundred years..."</p>
        <p>Rabbi Akiva was once sitting and lecturing, and the community [his students] was falling
            asleep. To arouse them, he said: How could Esther rule over one hundred and twenty seven
            provinces? It should be that Esther, a descendant of Sarah who lived to one hundred and
            twenty seven, to rule over one hundred and twenty seven provinces.</p>
        <p>And Avraham came to eulogize Sarah-From where did he come? Rabbi levi said: He came to
            Sarah from the burial of Terach. Rabbi Yossi said to him: And did not the burial of
            Terach precede the burial of Sarah by two years?! Rather, from where did he come? From
            Mount Moriah.</p>

        <p>R. Isaac said: "A year which is poor (Israel appears humble) in the beginning, will be
            rich in the end (Israel's request will be granted). What is the reason for it? For it is
            written (Deut. 11, 12) From the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year;
            i.e., there are two parts in a year, the beginning and the end." (Ib. b) K. Isaac said
            again: "A man is judged only according to his deeds at the time of sentence; as it is
            said (Gen. 21, 17) God heard the voice of the lad, as he then was." Another thing R.
            Isaac said: "Three things cause a man's record of sins to be recalled. Three occasions
            cause the sins of man to be brought to mind : a threatening wall, calculating during
            prayer, and one who appeals to the Lord for judgment on his neighbor; for R. Chanin
            said: 'Whoever appeals to the Lord for judgment on his neighbor is first punished; as we
            find in the case of Sarah, who said (Gen. 16, 5) I suffer wrong through thee, may the
            Lord judge between me and thee. And shortly after this we read (Ib. 23, 2) And Abraham
            came to mourn Sarah and to weep for her.'" Another thing said R. Isaac: "Four things
            cause an evil decree which is passed on man to be torn (annulled). They are charity,
            prayer, change of name and change of conduct: Charity, as it is written (Prov. 10, 2)
            Charity delivereth from death; prayer, as it is WTitten (Ps. 97, 19) They cry unto the
            Lord when they are in distress, and He saveth them out of their afflictions; change of
            name, as it is written (Gen. 17, 15) As for Sarai, thy wife, thou shalt not call her
            name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be: and the text continues saying: Then will I
            bless her, and give thee a son also, because of her change of conduct; as it is written
            (Jonah 3, 10) And God saw their works that they had turned from their evil ways; and
            immediately following: And God bethought Himself of the evil He had said He would do
            unto them, and He did it not." Some add also the change of location ; as it is said
            (Gen. 12, 1-2) And God said to Abraham, get thee out from thy land [and afterwards] I
            will make of thee a great nation. But the former authority claims that the latter one
            was on account of the merits of the land of Israel.</p>

        </source>
        <p>(Lev. 16:1:) “After the death of Aaron's two sons.” This text is related (to Eccl. 9:2),
            “Since everything [happens] to everyone, the same lot [falls] to the righteous and to
            the wicked […].” Solomon looked and foresaw the righteous and the wicked in all
            generations, and he saw things that would happen to the righteous and happen to the
            wicked.1 Then he said (in vs. 3), “This is an evil in all which happens under the sun,
            in that the same lot [falls] to everyone.” (Vs. 2:) “Since everything [happens] to
            everyone, the same lot [falls] to the righteous.” This refers to Abraham, in that he was
            called righteous, as stated (in Gen. 18:19), “For I have chosen him [so] that he may
            charge [his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord], to
            practice righteousness.” (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “And to the wicked.” This refers to Nimrod,
            who incited all the whole world against the Holy One, blessed be He. The former is dead,
            and the latter is dead. (Ibid., cont.:) “To the good, to the clean, and to the unclean.”
            “To the good” refers to David, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 16:12), “So they sent and
            brought him, reddish, with beautiful eyes and good appearance.” “To the unclean” refers
            to Nebuchadnezzar. David [laid the foundation of] the Temple, and Nebuchadnezzar
            destroyed it. The former reigned forty years, and the latter reigned forty years.
            (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) “To the one who sacrifices.” This refers to Solomon, of whom it is
            stated (in I Kings 8:63), “Solomon sacrificed [twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred
            and twenty thousand sheep] as peace offerings.” (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) “And to the one who
            does not sacrifice.” This refers to Jeroboam, who stopped Israel from going up [to
            Jerusalem] on pilgrimage, as stated (in I Kings 12:28), “Enough of your going up to
            Jerusalem.” The latter one reigned after the former one. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “As it is
            with the good.” This refers to Moses, of whom it is stated (in Exod. 2:2), “and when she
            saw that he was good.” (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “So it is with the sinner.” This refers to
            the spies (in Numb. 13-14), of whom it is stated (in Prov. 13:21), “Evil pursues
            sinners.” Moses did not enter the land, neither did the spies enter the land. (Eccl.
            9:2, cont.:) “And the one who takes an oath (without keeping it). This refers to
            Zedekiah, of whom it is stated (in II Chron. 36:13), “And he also rebelled against King
            Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath of God.” (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “Is as the
            one who fears an oath.” This refers to Samson, of whom it is stated (in Jud. 15:12),
            “then Samson said to them, ‘Swear to me […].’” They put out the eyes of the former, and
            they put out the eyes of the latter. Hence Solomon said (Eccl 9:3), “This is an evil in
            all which happens under the sun.” Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:2), “as it is with
            the good”: This refers to the children of Aaron. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “So it is with the
            sinner.” This refers to those who opposed Aaron, [namely] Korah and his congregation.
            Now they were destroyed by fire, as stated (in Numb. 16:35), “And a fire went forth from
            the Lord”; [also when] the children of Aaron entered to offer sacrifice, they were
            consumed by fire, [as stated (Lev. 10:2),] “So fire came forth from before the Lord and
            consumed them.” R. Abba bar Kahana opened (with Eccl. 2:2), “’Of laughter I said, “It is
            mad,” and of rejoicing, “What does that do?”’ How confused is the laughter of the evil,2
            which they produce in their theater3 [houses] and racing arenas.4 ‘And of rejoicing,
            what does that do?’ What enjoyment would the disciples of the sages have there?”5
            Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad’”: R. Aha said,
            “Solomon has said, ‘There are things over which divine justice laughs (that I have
            confused).’ It is written (in Deut. 17:17), ‘he shall not multiply wives for himself’;
            but it is written (in I Kings 11:3), ‘So he had seven hundred royal wives.’6 It is
            written (in Deut. 17:16), ‘he shall not multiply horses for himself’; but it is written
            (in I Kings 5:6), ‘Now Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses.’ It is written (in
            Deut. 17:17, cont.) ‘he shall not multiply silver and gold for himself’; but it is
            written (in I Kings 10:27), ‘And the king made silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as
            stones,’ and [the ingots] were not stolen.” R. Jose bar Hanina said, “They were like
            stones of ten cubits and like stones of eight cubits.”7 R. Simeon ben Johay said in a
            baraita, “Even the weights which they had in the days of Solomon were of gold, as it is
            written, (in I Kings 10:21), ‘silver was not [...] considered to be anything.’” (Eccl.
            2:2:) “And of rejoicing, ‘What does that do?’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him,
            “What is this crown doing in your hand? Get down off your throne.” Immediately an angel
            in the likeness of Solomon descended and sat upon his throne. Then Solomon went around
            among the synagogues and academies in Jerusalem and said (in Eccl. 1:12), “I, Koheleth,
            was king over Israel in Jerusalem.” But they said to him, “King Solomon is sitting on
            his throne, and you are getting crazier and crazier.” Then they struck him with a rod
            and set a bowl of grits before him.8 In that hour Solomon said (in Eccl. 2:10), “And
            this was my portion from all my labor.” And some say [he was referring] to the cane in
            his hand, and some say, to his dish, and some say to his staff. At that time, Solomon
            said, “’Vanity of vanities,’ said Koheleth.” (Eccl. 2:2:), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is
            mad!’” R. Pinhas said, “How confused was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over
            the generation of the flood, as stated (in Job 21:10-13), ‘Their bull breeds and does
            not fail […].9 They send forth their little ones like a flock […]. They sing to timbrel
            and harp […]. They spend [their days] in prosperity.’ When they said (in vs. 15), ‘What
            is the Almighty that we should serve him,’ the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them (in
            Eccl. 2:2), ‘And of rejoicing, “What does that do?”’ By your life, I am destroying your
            memory from the world, as stated (in Gen. 7:23), “And He wiped out all living things.”’”
            Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad’”: How confused
            was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over the people of Sodom,10 as stated (Job
            28:5-8), “The earth, out of it comes forth bread…. Its stones are the place of
            sapphires…. No bird of prey knows a path [to it]…. Proud beasts have not trodden it.”
            When they said, “Let us forget the law of the traveler in our midst,” immediately (in
            Job 28:4), “A stream burst through from its source”; the Holy One, blessed be He, said
            to them (Eccl. 2:2), “’And of rejoicing, “What does that do?”’ By your life, I will make
            you forgotten by the world.” This is what is written (in Gen. 19:24), “Then the Lord
            rained down upon Sodom….” Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said,
            ‘It is mad’”: How confused was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over Elisheba
            bat Amminadab,11 when she saw four celebrations in one day.12 She saw her
            [brother-in-law] (Moses) a king, her husband a high priest, her brother (Naashon) a
            prince (nasi),13 and her two sons deputy high priests. When they went in to offer
            sacrifice, they came out destroyed by fire; and her celebration turned into mourning, as
            stated (in Lev. 16:1), “Now the Lord spoke unto Moses after the death of Aaron's two
            sons.”</p>

        <p>THE GATHERING OF THE WATERS</p>
        <p>ON the third day all the earth was flat like a plain and the waters covered the surface
            of all the earth. When the word of the Almighty was uttered, "Let the waters be gathered
            together" (Gen. 1:9), the mountains and hills arose from the ends of the earth and they
            were scattered over the surface of all the earth, and valleys were formed over the inner
            parts of the earth; and the waters were rolled together and gathered into the valleys,
            as it is said, "And the gathering together of the waters he called seas" (Gen. 1:10).
            Forthwith the waters became proud and they arose to cover the earth as at first, when
            the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them || and subdued them, and placed them beneath
            the soles of His feet, and measured them with the hollow of His hand that they should
            neither decrease nor increase. He made the sand as the boundary of the sea, just like a
            man who makes a fence for his vineyard. When they rise and see the sand before them they
            return to their former place, as it is said, "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye
            not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea?" (Jer.
            5:22).</p>

        <p>Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah the Prince, said: When our father Abraham was
            circumcised, on the third day he was very sore, in order to test him. What did the Holy
            One, blessed be He, do? He pierced one hole in the midst of Gehinnom, and He made the
            day hot, like the day of the wicked. He went forth, and sat down at the entrance of the
            tent in the cool of the day, as it is said, "And he sat at the tent door (in the heat of
            the day)" (Gen. 18:1). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: Come
            ye, let us descend and visit the sick, for the virtue of visiting the sick is great
            before Me. The Holy One, blessed be He, and the angels descended to visit our father
            Abraham, as it is said, "And the Lord appeared unto him" (ibid.). The Holy One, blessed
            be He, said to the ministering angels: Come ye and see ye the power of circumcision.
            Before Abraham was circumcised he fell on his face (before Me), and afterwards I spake
            with him, as it is said, "And Abraham fell upon his face" (Gen. 17:17). Now that he is
            circumcised he sits and I stand. Whence do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, was
            standing? Because it is said, "And he looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him"
            (Gen. 18:2).</p>
