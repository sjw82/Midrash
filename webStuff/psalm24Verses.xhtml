		<h3>Psalm 24 (1-10)</h3>
		<p>1 Of David. A psalm. The earth is the LORD’s and all that it holds, the world and its inhabitants.</p>
		<p>2 For He founded it upon the ocean, set it on the nether-streams.</p>
		<p>3 Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?—</p>
		<p>4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not taken a false oath by 
			My life or sworn deceitfully.</p>
		<p>5 He shall carry away a blessing from the LORD, a just reward from God, his 
			deliverer.</p>
		<p>6 Such is the circle of those who turn to Him, Jacob, who seek Your presence.
			Selah.</p>
		<p>7 O gates, lift up your heads! Up high, you everlasting doors, so the King of 
			glory may come in!</p>
		<p>8 Who is the King of glory?— the LORD, mighty and valiant, the LORD, valiant 
			in battle.</p>
		<p>9 O gates, lift up your heads! Lift them up, you everlasting doors, so the 
			King of glory may come in!</p>
		<p>10 Who is the King of glory?— the LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory!
			Selah.</p>
