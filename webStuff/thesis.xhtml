        <!--#include virtual="navBar.xhtml" -->
        <div id="pagecontent"><p>In this research project, we focused on marking up different passages from 
		midrashim that comment on the verses that we chose with the goal of marking up 
		the different types of references and structures that appear. We did this in 
		order to perform an analysis of trends that appear within a selection of midrash 
		by comparing Midrash Aggada and Hallacha. </p></div>
