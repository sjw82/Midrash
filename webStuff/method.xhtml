    	<div id="pagecontent"><p>Once we defined our research area we all decided to choose a story or passage 
		from the Torah that we personally were interested in analyzing. Through meetings 
		with Dr. Adam Shear in the Religious Studies department we concluded that it would 
		be best that we pick stories/passage with different focuses and in different 
		sections of the Torah. For this reason, we picked passages from the book of Genesis, 
		Hebrews, and the Psalms. Once we picked our passages and roughly 10-13 Midrashim 
		passages for the verses we each marked up our texts individually associating our xml 
		with the schema that Samantha created.</p>
		<p>In our markup, we focused on marking up references (e.g. reference to other 
		biblical verses, rabbi names, different names for God, important items, etc.), 
		quotes and quotations, speeches, and literal Hebrew text with its translations.</p></div>
