        <!--#include virtual="navBar.xhtml" -->
        <h3>Genesis 17:15-19</h3>
        <div id="pagecontent"> <p>15 And God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her Sarai, but her
            name shall be Sarah.</p>
        <p>16 I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she
            shall give rise to nations; rulers of peoples shall issue from her.”</p>
        <p>17 Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed, as he said to himself, “Can a child be
            born to a man a hundred years old, or can Sarah bear a child at ninety?”</p>
        <p>18 And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live by Your favor!”</p>
        <p>19 God said, “Nevertheless, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall name him
            Isaac; and I will maintain My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his
            offspring to come.</p></div>
