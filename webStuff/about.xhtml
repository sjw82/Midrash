    	<div id="pagecontent"><h2 id="history">Midrash History</h2>
    		<p>The Midrashim are ancient rabbinic texts in which Rabbis works through the 
		texts of the Torah to create connections between both different parts of the 
		texts and between the text and real life in order to explore religious questions 
		that appear in every-day life. There are two types of Midrash, Midrash Halacha, and 
		Midrash Aggadah. The Midrash Halacha focus on topics relating to law and religious 
		practices and the Midrash Aggadah focus on interpreting the stories in the Torah 
		and through this exploring theological and practical religious questions and 
		creating parables and lessons.</p> 
		<p>The Midrash Aggadah are texts that were compiled mostly between 200 and 1000 AD. 
		We choose to look at these texts because we decided to focus on specific verses in 
		the Torah and how they are connected to others by the rabbinic writers. We also 
		looked at a couple of Midrash Halacha because we were also interested in looking at 
		the more legal and practical side of what happens in these verses.</p>
		<p>Midrash are still being written today and their long history is a fascinating 
		story in itself. Today a lot of effort is put into translating the midrash and 
		digitizing the translations in databases such as <i>sefaria.org</i> to make them more 
		accessible to the public.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2 id="thesis">Thesis/Research Question</h2>
        <p>In this research project, we focused on marking up different passages from 
		midrashim that comment on the verses that we chose with the goal of marking up 
		the different types of references and structures that appear. We did this in 
		order to perform an analysis of trends that appear within a selection of midrash 
		by comparing Midrash Aggada and Hallacha. </p>
		<br/>
		<h2 id="translation">Translation</h2>
		<p>In the analysis of ancient texts one of the primary challenges is that of 
		translation. Especially since nobody in our group can read modern Hebrew, much 
		less ancient rabbinic Hebrew, this was one of the first challenges that we ran 
		into. With translations of texts, especially religious and philosophical texts, 
		it is often hard to match up the English translation to what the original language 
		actually means. As a result, a different translation of a word might be used that 
		could alter the meaning of a passage completely. The translation might also prove 
		difficult with some names and titles as well as certain references and idioms that 
		only make sense in the original language.</p>
		<p>In order to prevent confusion with different translations of the verses and 
		midrash that we used, we decided to use the translations that are available on 
		sefaria.org which all use the same translation for the actual text they are 
		commenting on.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
    	<p>Once we defined our research area we all decided to choose a story or passage 
		from the Torah that we personally were interested in analyzing. Through meetings 
		with Dr. Adam Shear in the Religious Studies department we concluded that it would 
		be best that we pick stories/passage with different focuses and in different 
		sections of the Torah. For this reason, we picked passages from the book of Genesis, 
		Hebrews, and the Psalms. Once we picked our passages and roughly 10-13 Midrashim 
		passages for the verses we each marked up our texts individually associating our xml 
		with the schema that Samantha created.</p>
		<p>In our markup, we focused on marking up references (e.g. reference to other 
		biblical verses, rabbi names, different names for God, important items, etc.), 
		quotes and quotations, speeches, and literal Hebrew text with its translations.</p></div>
