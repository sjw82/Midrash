       <h1>Translation</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="navBar.xhtml" -->
		<p>In the analysis of ancient texts one of the primary challenges is that of 
		translation. Especially since nobody in our group can read modern Hebrew, much 
		less ancient rabbinic Hebrew, this was one of the first challenges that we ran 
		into. With translations of texts, especially religious and philosophical texts, 
		it is often hard to match up the English translation to what the original language 
		actually means. As a result, a different translation of a word might be used that 
		could alter the meaning of a passage completely. The translation might also prove 
		difficult with some names and titles as well as certain references and idioms that 
		only make sense in the original language.</p>
		<p>In order to prevent confusion with different translations of the verses and 
		midrash that we used, we decided to use the translations that are available on 
		sefaria.org which all use the same translation for the actual text they are 
		commenting on.</p>
