And the angel of Ad-nai called to him out of heaven, and said: Abraham, Abraham Gen. 22:11. Rabbi Hiya taught: This is an expression of love, this is an expression of 
            urging. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: He spoke to him and to future generations, there is no generation which does not contain people like Avraham, and there is no 
                generation which does not contain people like Yaakov, Moshe, and Shmuel. And he said: "Do not lay your hand etc." Gen. 22:12 Where was the knife? Three tears had fallen 
                from the angels of service and the knife dissolved. Avraham said: I will strangle him, He said: Do not lay your hand upon the lad. [Avraham] said I will take a drop 
                    of blood from him - He said to him: ‘Neither do anything [me'uma] to him’ [meaning] inflict no blemish [muma] upon him. "Because now I know" [meaning] I have made it 
                known to all that you love Me, "and you have not withheld, etc". And do not say that all ills that do not affect one’s own body are not ills, rather I ascribe merit to 
                you as though I had told to you to sacrifice yourself and you did not refuse.
