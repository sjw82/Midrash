And it came to pass after these words that God did prove Abraham Gen. 22:1. Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: Forasmuch as the king’s word hath power; and who may say 
            unto him: “What dost thou?” whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing Eccles. 8:4–5. What is meant by this verse? Whatsoever the Holy One, blessed be He, desires to do, He may 
            do, and none may stay His hand. What then can be the meaning of And who may say unto Him: “What doest Thou?” whoso keepeth the commandment, etc.? These words whoso keepeth the commandment 
            allude to the righteous men who perform the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. And it is their decree that He fulfills, as it is written: Thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall 
            be established unto thee, and the light shall shine upon thy ways Job 22:28. An example of this is what occurred after they made the golden calf. Though the Holy One, blessed be He, desired 
            to destroy them, our master, Moses, restrained the Holy One, blessed be He, as though that were possible, just as a man restrains his companion. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to 
            him: And now let Me be Exod. 32:10. We learn this as well from the verse: Let Me alone that I may destroy them Deut. 9:14. Therefore Scripture says: Who may say unto him: “What doest 
                thou?” whoso keepeth the commandment.
