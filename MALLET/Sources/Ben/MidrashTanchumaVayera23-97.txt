The Holy One, blessed be He, answered: You have spoken what was in you heart, now I will say what I wish to say. In the future Isaacâ€™s descendants will sin against Me, and I will judge them 
            on Rosh Hashanah. If they want Me to discover something to their credit, and to recall for their advantage the binding of Isaac, let them blow upon this shofar. Abraham asked: What shofar? 
            The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Turn around. Then it was that Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind a ram caught in the thicket by his horns Gen. 22:13. This was 
            one of the ten things that were created at twilight.17
