Another interpretation of Gen. 22:6, cont.: SO BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF TOGETHER. R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: While they were walking, Satan came to Isaac on his right hand and said: 
            Alas, wretched son of a wretched woman, how many fasts did your mother fast until you came?172 Now the old man has gone mad in his old age, and here he is going to slaughter you. 
            Isaac turned back and said to his father: Look at what this one is saying to me! He said to him: He has come to confuse you, but the Holy One shall not 
            confuse us, as stated in Gen. 22:8: GOD WILL SEE TO THE LAMB FOR A BURNT OFFERING. So nevertheless according to Gen. 22:6: SO BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF TOGETHER. How old was Isaac? He was 
            thirty-seven years old.173
