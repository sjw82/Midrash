God said...,Sarai your wife... In Proverbs 12:4, it is written,
                A woman of valor is a crown to her
                husband.
            Rabbi Aha said, Her husband was crowned through her, but
                she was not crowned through her husband. Our rabbis taught that she ruled
            over her husband. In all places, the man gives orders, but here Genesis 21:12, In all that Sarah orders you, listen to her voice.
            Said Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Korcha: The Yud that the Holy One of Blessing
            took from Sarai was given half to Sarah, and half to Avraham. Said Rabbi Shime'on Bar
                Yochai: The Yud that the
                Holy One of Blessing took from Sarai flew
            and posted itself in front of the Throne of the Holy One, and said: Master of the Universe! Because
                I am the smallest letter You took me out of the name of Sarai the
                Righteous!!
            The Holy One said: In the past you were
                in the name of a woman, and in the end of the name! Now I will put you in the name
                of a man, and on the beginning of the name, as it is written
            And Moshe called Hosea Bin Nun
                Yehoshua
            Numbers 13:16. Said Rabbi Mana: Sarai was just [a princess]
            for herself, now she will be a princess for all the world.
