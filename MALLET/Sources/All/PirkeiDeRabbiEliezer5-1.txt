THE GATHERING OF THE WATERS ON the third day all the earth was flat like a plain and the waters covered the surface
            of all the earth. When the word of the Almighty was uttered, "Let the waters be gathered
            together" (Gen. 1:9), the mountains and hills arose from the ends of the earth and they
            were scattered over the surface of all the earth, and valleys were formed over the inner
            parts of the earth; and the waters were rolled together and gathered into the valleys,
            as it is said, "And the gathering together of the waters he called seas" (Gen. 1:10).
            Forthwith the waters became proud and they arose to cover the earth as at first, when
            the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them || and subdued them, and placed them beneath
            the soles of His feet, and measured them with the hollow of His hand that they should
            neither decrease nor increase. He made the sand as the boundary of the sea, just like a
            man who makes a fence for his vineyard. When they rise and see the sand before them they
            return to their former place, as it is said, "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye
            not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea?" (Jer.
            5:22).
