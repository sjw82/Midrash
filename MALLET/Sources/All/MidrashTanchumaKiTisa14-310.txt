R. Nehemiah declared: "When we
                examine our actions, we are filled with shame. Usually when a man gives his field to
                a tenant to work, the tenant supplies the seed and the labor, and they share equally
                in the produce. But the Holy One, blessed be He, of whom
                it is written: The Earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof
                Ps. 24:1, causes the rain and the dew
                to descend and protects everything, yet He desires only one tenth as tithe and one
                fiftieth as the priestly offering. Hence, Unto Thee, O
                        Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion
                    of face
                Dan. 9:7."
            R. Yosé said: "Was there a more shameful
                act than this? Israel crossed the Red Sea, and the idol Micah
                had made was carried with them when, as it is said: And over the tree affliction
                    shall pass
                Zech. 10:11. Nevertheless the
                sea split asunder for them. Therefore, Unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of
                    face."
