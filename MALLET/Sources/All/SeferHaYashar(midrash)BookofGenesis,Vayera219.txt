And Abraham slew the ram upon the altar for a burnt offering before the Lord instead of his ‎son Isaac; and Abraham sprinkled of the blood of the ram upon the altar, and he 
            exclaimed, ‎saying: This is instead of my son, and may it be considered as the blood of my son before the ‎Lord, even on this day; and whatsoever Abraham performed upon that occasion he 
            always ‎accompanied it by these words: This is in the place of my son, and may it be considered this ‎day before the Lord in place of my son. And when Abraham had completed the services at 
            the ‎altar, and the offering was accepted by the Lord, it was actually considered as if it had been ‎Isaac that was sacrificed. And the Lord blessed Abraham and his seed on that day. And 
            Satan ‎hurried unto Sarah and appeared unto her in the guise of a very humble and lowly old man, ‎while Abraham was still performing his duties at the altar before the Lord. And Satan said 
            unto ‎Sarah: Knowest thou not the work that Abraham hath done with thine only son to-day? Verily, ‎he hath taken Isaac and built an altar and killed him and brought him for a burnt 
                offering upon ‎the altar; and Isaac was weeping and praying before his father, but he never heeded his cries ‎and he had no mercy upon him.‎‏ ‏And after repeating his story, Satan departed 
            from Sarah; and ‎Sarah having heard these words of Satan, took him for one of the sons of man who had been ‎with her son and who had come to tell her these words.‎‏ ‏And Sarah lifted up her 
            voice and she ‎wept and cried bitterly over the loss of her son; and she lay down upon the ground and she ‎scattered dust upon her head, and she exclaimed: Oh, my son, Isaac | oh, my son 
                would that I ‎had died to-day in thy place | And she continued weeping and crying: It grieves me for thy ‎sake, oh, my son I Would that I had died to-day in thy place! And she kept on 
            lamenting, and ‎she said: It grieves me for thy sake, now after I have raised thee and brought thee up, my joy ‎hath been turned into mourning for thee, I who was yearning for thee, I who 
                have been crying ‎and praying to the Lord for thee until I bare thee at the age of ninety years, and now hast thou ‎been given up to-day to the knife and to the fire to be made a burnt 
                offering; yet I will take ‎comfort, my son, in the thought that all hath been caused by the word of the Lord, as thou ‎hast performed the commandment of thy God, and who can rebel 
                against the word of God in ‎whose hand is the soul of every living creature? Thou art just, O Lord our God, and all thy ‎works are justice and righteousness; and I am exceedingly glad at 
                the words of thy command, ‎and though mine eye weepeth, my heart rejoiceth within me.‎‏ ‏And Sarah placed her head ‎upon the bosom of one of her maid servants and she became silent like a 
            rock. And soon after ‎she arose and went about to make inquiries until she reached Hebron. And she questioned ‎every passer-by that she met on the road, but no one could tell her 
            anything concerning the ‎fate of her son.‎
