R. Eliezer b. Jacob says: "Whoever wears Phylacteries upon his head, Phylacteries
                upon his hand, fringes on his cloak and has a Mezuzah on
                his door-post, these all will preserve him from sin, as it is said Ecc. 4, 12
                And a threefold
                        cord is not quickly broken, and again there is another verse
                        Ps. 24, 8
                The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear the
                        Lord."
