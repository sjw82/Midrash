Numb. 34:2, “This is the land that shall fall to you as an
                inheritance.” What is the meaning of “to
                you?”
            To you it is fitting. The matter is comparable to a
            king who had male and female slaves and would have his male slaves marry female slaves
            from another estate and his female slaves marry male salves from a different estate.30
            The king stopped and reflected. He said, “The male slaves are mine and the female slaves are mine. It would be
                better for me to marry my male slaves
                'avadim to my female slaves, my own to my
                own.” Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said,
                “The land is Mine, as stated in Ps. 24:1, ‘The land is the Lord's and all that is in
                    it.’ Moreover Israel is Mine, as stated in Lev. 25:55, ‘For to Me the Children of Israel are servants
                    'avadim.’ It is better for Me to
                bequeath My land to my servants who belong to Me, My own to My own.” It is
            therefore stated in Numb.
                34:2, “this is the land that shall fall
                to you.” Another interpretation of Numb. 34:2, “this is the
                land”: This text is related to Ps.
                    111:6, “He revealed to His people His
                powerful works.” The Holy One, blessed be He,
            said to Israel, “I could have created a different desirable
                land for you. But in order to show you My strength, I am expelling your enemies in
                front of you and giving you their land, to fulfill that which is stated, ‘He revealed His powerful works....’”
