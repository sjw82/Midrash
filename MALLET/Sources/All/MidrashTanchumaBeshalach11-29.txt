A mortal king is praised as mighty, though he may be weak, and as rich, merciful, and
            handsome, because they wish to flatter him. But concerning the Holy
                One, blessed be He, they say: The great God, the  mighty God,
                and the awful
            Deut. 10:17; The Lord will go forth as a mighty man
            Isa. 42:13; There is none like unto thee, O Lord
            Jer. 10:6. They say He is rich, and
            indeed there are no limits to his wealth, For behold,
                unto the Lord thy God belongeth the heaven, and the
                heaven of heavens
            Deut. 10:14. And it is written
            also: The sea is His, and He made it, and His hands formed the
                dry land
            Ps. 95:5; The
                earth is the Lordâ€™s, and the fullness thereof
            ibid. 24:1; Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold
            Hag. 2:8; Behold, all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the
                son
            Ezek. 18:4.
