Rabbi Jehudah said: In that night the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto him. He
            said to him: Abraham ! Dost thou not know that Sarah was appointed to thee for a wife
            from her mother's womb? She is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant; Sarah is not
            called thy handmaid, but thy wife; neither is Hagar called thy wife, but thy handmaid;
            and all that Sarah has spoken she has uttered truthfully. Let it not be grievous in
            thine eyes, as it is said, "And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy
            sight" (Gen. 21:12).
