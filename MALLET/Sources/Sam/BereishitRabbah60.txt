And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother- All the days that Sarah was alive, a cloud was
            connected
                lit.
                tied to the entrance of her tent. When she died, the cloud stopped resting at her tent. And when Rebecca came, the cloud returned.
            All the days that Sarah was alive, the doors were open wide. When she died, the wideness stopped.
            And when Rebecca came, the wideness
                returned. And all the days that Sarah was alive,
            there was a blessing in her dough, and when Sarah died, that blessing ended. When Rebecca came, the blessing returned. All
            the days that Sarah was alive, there was a candle that would burn from Sabbath Eve to the next
            Sabbath Eve, and when she died, the candle stopped burning for so long. And when
                Rebecca came, the week-long flame of the
                candle returned. And as soon as Isaac saw her, that she did the deeds of his
                mother, separating her challah in purity and separating
                her dough in purity, he brought her into the tent.
                Rabbi Yudan said, The Torah teaches
                you, that if a man has grown-up sons, he should marry them off first and then he
                should marry. Who do you learn this teaching from? From Abraham: first, And
                    Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and afterwards,
                    And Abraham took another wife, and her name was
                    Keturah.
