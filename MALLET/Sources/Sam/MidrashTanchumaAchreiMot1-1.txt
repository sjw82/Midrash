(Lev. 16:1:) “After the death of Aaron's two sons.” This text is related (to Eccl. 9:2),
            “Since everything [happens] to everyone, the same lot [falls] to the righteous and to
            the wicked […].” Solomon looked and foresaw the righteous and the wicked in all
            generations, and he saw things that would happen to the righteous and happen to the
            wicked.1 Then he said (in vs. 3), “This is an evil in all which happens under the sun,
            in that the same lot [falls] to everyone.” (Vs. 2:) “Since everything [happens] to
            everyone, the same lot [falls] to the righteous.” This refers to Abraham, in that he was
            called righteous, as stated (in Gen. 18:19), “For I have chosen him [so] that he may
            charge [his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord], to
            practice righteousness.” (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “And to the wicked.” This refers to Nimrod,
            who incited all the whole world against the Holy One, blessed be He. The former is dead,
            and the latter is dead. (Ibid., cont.:) “To the good, to the clean, and to the unclean.”
            “To the good” refers to David, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 16:12), “So they sent and
            brought him, reddish, with beautiful eyes and good appearance.” “To the unclean” refers
            to Nebuchadnezzar. David [laid the foundation of] the Temple, and Nebuchadnezzar
            destroyed it. The former reigned forty years, and the latter reigned forty years.
            (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) “To the one who sacrifices.” This refers to Solomon, of whom it is
            stated (in I Kings 8:63), “Solomon sacrificed [twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred
            and twenty thousand sheep] as peace offerings.” (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) “And to the one who
            does not sacrifice.” This refers to Jeroboam, who stopped Israel from going up [to
            Jerusalem] on pilgrimage, as stated (in I Kings 12:28), “Enough of your going up to
            Jerusalem.” The latter one reigned after the former one. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “As it is
            with the good.” This refers to Moses, of whom it is stated (in Exod. 2:2), “and when she
            saw that he was good.” (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “So it is with the sinner.” This refers to
            the spies (in Numb. 13-14), of whom it is stated (in Prov. 13:21), “Evil pursues
            sinners.” Moses did not enter the land, neither did the spies enter the land. (Eccl.
            9:2, cont.:) “And the one who takes an oath (without keeping it). This refers to
            Zedekiah, of whom it is stated (in II Chron. 36:13), “And he also rebelled against King
            Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath of God.” (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “Is as the
            one who fears an oath.” This refers to Samson, of whom it is stated (in Jud. 15:12),
            “then Samson said to them, ‘Swear to me […].’” They put out the eyes of the former, and
            they put out the eyes of the latter. Hence Solomon said (Eccl 9:3), “This is an evil in
            all which happens under the sun.” Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:2), “as it is with
            the good”: This refers to the children of Aaron. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) “So it is with the
            sinner.” This refers to those who opposed Aaron, [namely] Korah and his congregation.
            Now they were destroyed by fire, as stated (in Numb. 16:35), “And a fire went forth from
            the Lord”; [also when] the children of Aaron entered to offer sacrifice, they were
            consumed by fire, [as stated (Lev. 10:2),] “So fire came forth from before the Lord and
            consumed them.” R. Abba bar Kahana opened (with Eccl. 2:2), “’Of laughter I said, “It is
            mad,” and of rejoicing, “What does that do?”’ How confused is the laughter of the evil,2
            which they produce in their theater3 [houses] and racing arenas.4 ‘And of rejoicing,
            what does that do?’ What enjoyment would the disciples of the sages have there?”5
            Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad’”: R. Aha said,
            “Solomon has said, ‘There are things over which divine justice laughs (that I have
            confused).’ It is written (in Deut. 17:17), ‘he shall not multiply wives for himself’;
            but it is written (in I Kings 11:3), ‘So he had seven hundred royal wives.’6 It is
            written (in Deut. 17:16), ‘he shall not multiply horses for himself’; but it is written
            (in I Kings 5:6), ‘Now Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses.’ It is written (in
            Deut. 17:17, cont.) ‘he shall not multiply silver and gold for himself’; but it is
            written (in I Kings 10:27), ‘And the king made silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as
            stones,’ and [the ingots] were not stolen.” R. Jose bar Hanina said, “They were like
            stones of ten cubits and like stones of eight cubits.”7 R. Simeon ben Johay said in a
            baraita, “Even the weights which they had in the days of Solomon were of gold, as it is
            written, (in I Kings 10:21), ‘silver was not [...] considered to be anything.’” (Eccl.
            2:2:) “And of rejoicing, ‘What does that do?’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him,
            “What is this crown doing in your hand? Get down off your throne.” Immediately an angel
            in the likeness of Solomon descended and sat upon his throne. Then Solomon went around
            among the synagogues and academies in Jerusalem and said (in Eccl. 1:12), “I, Koheleth,
            was king over Israel in Jerusalem.” But they said to him, “King Solomon is sitting on
            his throne, and you are getting crazier and crazier.” Then they struck him with a rod
            and set a bowl of grits before him.8 In that hour Solomon said (in Eccl. 2:10), “And
            this was my portion from all my labor.” And some say [he was referring] to the cane in
            his hand, and some say, to his dish, and some say to his staff. At that time, Solomon
            said, “’Vanity of vanities,’ said Koheleth.” (Eccl. 2:2:), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is
            mad!’” R. Pinhas said, “How confused was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over
            the generation of the flood, as stated (in Job 21:10-13), ‘Their bull breeds and does
            not fail […].9 They send forth their little ones like a flock […]. They sing to timbrel
            and harp […]. They spend [their days] in prosperity.’ When they said (in vs. 15), ‘What
            is the Almighty that we should serve him,’ the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them (in
            Eccl. 2:2), ‘And of rejoicing, “What does that do?”’ By your life, I am destroying your
            memory from the world, as stated (in Gen. 7:23), “And He wiped out all living things.”’”
            Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad’”: How confused
            was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over the people of Sodom,10 as stated (Job
            28:5-8), “The earth, out of it comes forth bread…. Its stones are the place of
            sapphires…. No bird of prey knows a path [to it]…. Proud beasts have not trodden it.”
            When they said, “Let us forget the law of the traveler in our midst,” immediately (in
            Job 28:4), “A stream burst through from its source”; the Holy One, blessed be He, said
            to them (Eccl. 2:2), “’And of rejoicing, “What does that do?”’ By your life, I will make
            you forgotten by the world.” This is what is written (in Gen. 19:24), “Then the Lord
            rained down upon Sodom….” Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said,
            ‘It is mad’”: How confused was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over Elisheba
            bat Amminadab,11 when she saw four celebrations in one day.12 She saw her
            [brother-in-law] (Moses) a king, her husband a high priest, her brother (Naashon) a
            prince (nasi),13 and her two sons deputy high priests. When they went in to offer
            sacrifice, they came out destroyed by fire; and her celebration turned into mourning, as
            stated (in Lev. 16:1), “Now the Lord spoke unto Moses after the death of Aaron's two
            sons.”
