...2. "And Sarai said to Abram, Look, the Lord has kept me from
                bearing (Gen.16:2) as follows: Said she, I know the source of my
                affliction: It is not as people say [of a barren woman], 'she needs a talisman, she
                needs a charm', but Look, the Lord has kept me from bearing. " , ...Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai said Hagar was Pharaoh's daughter.
            When he saw the deeds on behalf of Sarah in his house, he
            took his daughter and gave her to him, saying, 'better that my daughter by a maidservant
            in this house than a mistress in another house.' This is what is written: She had an Egyptian handmaid whose name was Hagar.
            [In other words:] ha agrikh: This
                    is your reward. And he went into Hagar and she conceived Gen. 16:4. Rabbi Levi bar Hayta said: She became pregnant at the first intimacy. Said
                Rabbi Eleazar: A woman never conceives by the first
            intimacy. An objection is raised: surely it is written, So both of Lot's daughters got
            pregnant by their father Gen. 19:36?
            Said R. Tanhuma: By an effort of will power they brought forth their virginity, and
            conceived at the second “act of intercourse”. [The first act is what they did to
            themselves. Said Rabbi Chanina ben Pazi: Thorns are neither weeded nor sown, but they
            grow and spring up on their own. But how much suffering and effort for wheat to grow!
            Why were the matriarchs barren? Rabbi Levi said in Rabbi Shila’s name and Rabbi Chelbo
            in R. Yochanan’s name: Because the Holy One of Blessing yearns for their prayers and
            supplications, as it is written 'O my dove, you on the clefts of the rock let Me see
            your face, let Me hear your voice' (Song of Songs 2:14): Why did I make you barren? In
            order to 'see your face... hear your voice'. Rabbi Azariah said in the name of Rabbi
            Yochanan bar Papa: So that their husbands might cling to them in their beauty. Rabbi
            Huna in the name of Rabbi Hiya bar Abba said: So that they might pass the greater part
            of their life without hard work. Rabbi Huna and R. Avun in the name of Rabbi Meir: So
            that their husbands might derive pleasure from them, for when a woman is with child she
            is disfigured and does not care for her appearance. The ninety years that Sarah did not
            bear she was like a bride in her canopy. Ladies would come to ask how she was, and she
            would say to them, 'Go and ask about the welfare of this wretched woman [Hagar]!' Hagar
            would tell them: 'My mistress Sarai is not inside what she is outside: she appears to be
            righteous but she is not righteous, had she been a righteous woman, see how many years
            have passed without her conceiving, whereas I conceived in one night!' Said Sarah: 'Am I
            going to argue with this woman?! I should argue with her master!...  'And Avram said to Sarai: do it her what is good in your eyes!' (Gen. 19:6) He said to
            her: "what do I care about her well being or her harm? [But] It is written: 'You will
            not deal with her as a slave since you humbled her' (Deuteronomy 21:14), and this one,
            after we made her suffer, we will enslave her? I don't care about her well being or her
            harm. [But] It is written 'he shall not have the right to sell her to foreigners, since
            he broke faith with her' (Exodus 21:8) and this one, after we made her a master we will
            make her a slave? I don't care about her well being or her harm." 'Then Sarai treated
            her harshly, and she ran away from her.' Rabbi Aba bar Kahana said: she forbade her from
            having sexual relations. Rabbi Berachia said: she slapped her face with a slipper. Rabbi
            Berachia in the name of Rabbi Aba Bar Kahana said: She made her carry water buckets and
            bath towels to the baths. And she called the name of Ad-nai who talked to her 'You are
            El-Roi' (Gen. 16:13) Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon and Rabbi Yochanan said, in the name of
            Rabbi Eleazar Bar Shimeon: The Holy One of Blessing did not grant speaking with women,
            with the exception of that righteous one [Sarah], and even that had a particular reason.
            Rabbi Aba said, in the name of Rabbi Beiri: How many roundabouts He did in order to talk
            to her! 'He said: 'no, you did laugh!'' (Gen. 18:16) But it is written: 'and she called
            the name of Ad-nai who talked to her 'You are El-Roi''! Rabbi Yehoshua Bar Nechemiah
            said: it was through an angel. But it is written: 'And God said to her'(Gen. 25:23)!
            Said Rabbi Levi, in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, in the name of Rabbi Yosi ben Zimra: it
            was through a name. 'You are El Roi' - said Rabbi Aivu: You are the one who sees the
            sufferings of the persecuted. 'Since she said: also, here [halom], I have seen after the
            One Who sees me.' She said: Not only I was granted a talk, but even royalty, as it is
            written: 'You that brought me this far [halom] (II Sam. 7:18). Not only I was granted to
            see with my mistress, but even if my mistress were with me right now she would not have
            seen. Another interpretation: Not only I was granted to see with my mistress, but now
            even when I am alone! Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman said: this is similar to a lady to whom
            the king said 'pass before me'. She passed before him but was relying on her slave, and
            hiding her face, and she did not see the king - but the slave did.
