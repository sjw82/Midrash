Ib. 9 But whence do we learn that one
            joy must not be mixed with another? Said R. Juda in the name of
                Samuel : "It is
                written I Kings 8, 65
                And Solomon held at the
                    time the feast, etc., seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. Now,
                if it be true that one joy may be mixed with another, why then did Solomon not postpone his feast until the festival ;
                for then the seven days of the festival would have served for both?"
            R. Parnach, in the name of R.
                Jochanan, said : "In that year the
                Israelites had not observed the Day of
                    Atonement and they were perturbed over the sin that might cause them
                destruction. Whereupon a heavenly voice came forth and said unto them: 'All of you are destined for the future
                world'" And whence do we learn that they were pardoned for that sin?
