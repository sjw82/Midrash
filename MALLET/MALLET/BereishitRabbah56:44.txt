And Itzchak spoke to Avraham his father, and said: My father Gen. 22:7. Samael went to the our father Avraham and said: “Old man, old man! Have you lost your mind 
            [lit. have you lost your heart]? You are going to slay a son given to you at the age of a hundred! Even this I do, replied he. [Samael said:] And if He sets you an 
                even greater test, can you stand it?! [as it is written] If a thing be put to you as a trial, will you be wearied Job 4:2? Even more than this, he replied. [Samael 
            said:] Tomorrow He will say to you, “You are guilty of murder, you murdered your son!” He replied: Still I go. Seeing that he could achieve nothing with him, he 
            approached Itzchak and said: Son of an unhappy mother! He is going to slay you! He replied: Still I go. Samael said: If so, all those fine tunics which your mother 
                made be a legacy for Ishmael, the hated of her house, and you don't care [lit. don't let it enter your heart]? If a word is not completely effective, it may yet be 
            effective in part, that’s why it is written, “And Itzchak spoke to Avraham his father, and said: My father”: why [his] father, [my] father twice? So that he should be 
            filled with compassion for him. And he said: Behold, the fire and the wood. Avraham said to him: May that man who has thus seduced him be drowned! Any way, God will 
                provide himself the lamb, my son”; and if not you are the lamb for the burnt-offering my son. So "they went both of them together" Gen. 22:8 — one to slaughter and 
            the other to be slaughtered.
